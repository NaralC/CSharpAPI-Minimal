## Command Line Snippets Minimal API

### With the introduction of countless backend and deployment concepts during my first internship, I aim to practice and broaden my understanding of them.
#### Such concepts and technologies include, but are not limited to:
- .NET and C# in General
- MS SQL Server Management Studio
- Dependency Injection
- Object-Relational Mapping (with Auto Mapper)
- Entity Framework (utilize Code-First approach for data migration)
- Docker Build & Docker Compose
- Azure (SQL Server + Container Instance)
- Testing endpoints with Swagger

### Overall architecture of a minimal API compared to an MVC one

> The main difference is integrating controllers with Program.cs â€” essentially a barebone version of MVC

### Features missing from a minimal API compared to a an MVC one:
 - Model Validation (the ability to evaluate whether controllers are doing their jobs properly)
 - JSONPatch (the ability to partially update a model, instead of entirely replacing it)
 - Filters (the ability to inject extra logic at different stages, such as user authorization)

### Testing endpoints with Swagger UI
> - To be added

### Azure Dashboard
> - To be added
